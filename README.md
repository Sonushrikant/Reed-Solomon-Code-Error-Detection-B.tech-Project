Abstract:
Our aim of the project is to implement this reed Solomon codes in a Verilog test bench, waveform and also to analyze the error probability that is occurring during transmission.
To perform this check one can start with simulating reed Solomon codes in MATLAB and then going for simulation in XILINX writing the Verilog code.
The encoder and decoder design of reed Solomon codes have got different algorithms. Based on the requirements I can use those algorithms.
There are difference between the algorithms is that of the computational calculations between them. The complexity of the code depends on the algorithm used.
I will be using Linear Feedback Shift Register circuit for designing the encoder
